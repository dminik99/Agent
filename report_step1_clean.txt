```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "int",
    "name": "string",
    "age": "int"
  },
  "count": 10,
  "cleaning_process": [
    {
      "step": "missing_values_handling",
      "description": "handled missing values"
    },
    {
      "step": "column_name_correction",
      "description": "corrected column names"
    }
  ]
}
```

This is the final answer because it shows that the `clean_dataframe` tool successfully cleaned the raw data, handled missing values, corrected column names, and saved the result as 'cleaned_data.csv'. The schema of the new file is also provided in JSON format.
