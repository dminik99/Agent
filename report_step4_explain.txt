The top 5 features driving the attacks are:

* pkseqid: This feature represents a unique identifier for each packet sequence. It is used by the model to identify and differentiate between different attack patterns.
* proto: This feature represents the protocol used in the network communication, such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP. The model uses this information to understand the type of traffic and potential vulnerabilities.
* saddr: This feature represents the source IP address of the packet. It is used by the model to identify the origin of the attack and track its progression.
* daddr: This feature represents the destination IP address of the packet. It is used by the model to understand the target of the attack and potential vulnerabilities in the network.
* category: This feature represents a high-level classification of the attack, such as denial-of-service (DoS) or unauthorized access. The model uses this information to provide a general understanding of the attack type and potential severity.

Note that these features are not just random numbers, but rather they represent specific technical aspects of network communication that are used by the model to make predictions about attacks.
