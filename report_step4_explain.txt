**Top Features and their Technical Representation**

1. **src_bytes**: This feature represents the number of bytes sent from the source IP address, which can be indicative of malicious activity.
2. **count**: This feature represents the total number of connections or requests made by an attacker, which can be a key indicator of a potential attack.
3. **dst_host_count**: This feature represents the number of distinct destination host addresses involved in an attack, which can help identify patterns and anomalies.
4. **dst_bytes**: This feature represents the number of bytes received from the destination IP address, which can provide insight into the nature of an attack.
5. **protocol_type**: This feature represents the type of protocol used by the attacker (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP), which can help identify specific types of attacks.

These features are ranked based on their importance in determining whether a sample is malicious or benign. The model's decision to classify a sample as malicious is heavily influenced by these features, making them crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms driving the model's predictions.
